As regards the further question as to 3) Whether the Notice under Section 153C of the Income Tax Act, 1961 is valid herein: In this regard, it is relevant to refer to Section 153C of the IT Act, which reads thus: Assessment of income of any other person. It was further contended by the Revenue that Section 34 of the Evidence Act, 1872 is applicable to the proceedings under Income Tax Act, as the Income tax Act, is itself a Code and accordingly, sought for dismissal of writ petitions. As regards the last limb of arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the Revenue that the writ petitions before the learned Single were not maintainable on the ground of alternative remedy and delay and laches is concerned, taking into consideration the fact that the impugned notices and the orders passed by the Revenue are contrary to the law declared by the Hon'ble Apex Court referred to above, in that view of the matter, it is trite law that the acceptance of writ petitions, despite having alternative remedy, is a rule of practice and not of jurisdiction and in this regard, the Division Bench of this Court in the case of U.M. An appeal in all cases cannot be said to have provided in all situations, where an appeal would be ineffective and writ petition in such a case is maintainable, vide Ram and Shyam Company vs. State of Harayana [AIR 1985 SC 1147].The Deputy Commissioner Of Income Tax vs Sunil Kumar Sharma on 22 January, 2024 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/190467531/ 30(f) Where an authority has acted without jurisdiction, High Court should not refuse to exercise its jurisdiction under Article 226 on the ground of existence of alternative remedy vide Dr. Smt.
